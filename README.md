**Task Description: Data Integration from Multiple Sources (General, 500 Words)**

---

The purpose of this task is to demonstrate the process of **data integration** by combining data from multiple, distinct sources into a single, unified report using **Microsoft Power BI**. This is a fundamental capability in modern business intelligence, where organizations often deal with data that originates from various platforms, formats, and systems. In this particular case, the sources involved are **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** and **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** files—two widely used and structurally different data formats.

The objective is to build a **Power BI report** that brings these diverse data sources together in a coherent way, ensuring that they are not only successfully connected but also modeled and related appropriately to support meaningful visualizations and insights. The task showcases the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats, transform them as needed, and align them to support integrated analysis within a single reporting environment.

The focus of this task is not only technical execution but also conceptual clarity—transforming disparate data into a logical and cohesive model that supports reporting objectives. The Power BI environment provides the tools to extract data from flat files (like CSV), hierarchical or nested structures (like JSON), and transform them through **Power Query**, using cleansing, reshaping, and joining techniques to harmonize the data.

Once integrated, the report must feature **visualizations** that highlight the successful merging of the two datasets. While the specific metrics and visuals are not the emphasis of this task, the report should be functional and demonstrate the capability to analyze and explore the unified data interactively. This includes the use of slicers, filters, or dynamic elements to validate that the data is working together correctly.

The final deliverable is a **.PBIX Power BI file** that represents a fully developed example of data integration and reporting. It should clearly illustrate the successful combination of the CSV and JSON data sources and provide at least a basic visual representation of the integrated data.

In terms of design, the report should follow best practices for clarity, simplicity, and usability. The user interface should be clean, with appropriately labeled visuals and sections that guide the viewer through the insights. While the data may be sample or simulated, the structure should mimic real-world scenarios where data comes in various forms and must be reconciled to provide actionable intelligence.

This task is an essential demonstration of data preparation and integration skills—critical for any data analyst or BI professional. It shows not only familiarity with Power BI as a reporting tool but also the ability to understand data relationships, perform transformations, and solve problems related to data consistency and alignment.

Overall, the task highlights the practical challenges and solutions involved in working with multi-source data environments and serves as a foundation for more advanced analytics projects where data integration is a key step toward creating valuable business insights.

**Note :** To obtain .json file, first run the python script.
